# Blocky Agent Board

This is the shared, append-only coordination board for humans and agents.
It is intentionally plain Markdown so local Codex, OpenCode, and GitHub
agents can all use it. The detailed requirements live in `WORK_ORDERS.md`.

## Rules

1. Claim one unblocked card before editing it.
2. Put your name/tier and expected files on the card.
3. Do not claim a dependent card until its prerequisites are marked done.
4. If two tasks touch the same core file, the T3 lead decides the order.
5. Never erase another agent's handoff; append a new entry.

## Current queue

| Card | Status | Owner | Tier | Needs | Expected files | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C0 | DONE | Codex | T3 | — | project config, board only | Godot 4.7.2 baseline and fresh-save self-test completed. |
| C1 | READY | unassigned | T1 | C0 | board/docs only | Inventory the existing uncommitted city/creator drafts. |
| C2 | BLOCKED | unassigned | T3 | C1 | decision docs only | Retain, replace, or park drafts. |
| C3 | BLOCKED | unassigned | T2 | C2 | new creator scene/script | Start the approved light UI only after draft decision. |
| C6 | BLOCKED | unassigned | T1 | C2 | wardrobe catalog data/assets | No core-code changes. |

## Handoff log

<!-- Append new handoffs below. Do not rewrite history. -->

### 2026-09-19 — PROJECT-SETUP — done
Owner: Codex (T3)
Changed: `README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `docs/PRODUCTION_BIBLE.md`, `docs/WORK_ORDERS.md`, `docs/AGENT_BOARD.md`
Verified: Documentation cross-links and task dependency order reviewed.
Next: C0 — establish and record the Godot baseline.
Notes: Existing city/creator changes are uncommitted drafts. They require C1/C2 review before becoming the accepted implementation.

### 2026-09-19 — C0 — done
Owner: Codex (T3)
Changed: project import cache only; no source changes for this card
Verified: Godot 4.7.2 headless fresh-save self-test completed successfully.
Next: C1 — inventory the committed city/creator draft before the next implementation card.
Notes: The creator draft had two Godot parse issues (typed color inference and a wrapped format expression); both were corrected before the test run.

### 2026-09-19 — WATER-01 — done
Owner: Codex (T3)
Changed: `scripts/player.gd`, `tools/selftest.gd`
Verified: Godot 4.7.2 fresh-save self-test: normal swimming 3.0, Shift + direction underwater 4.9–5.0, water tiles 0/868 dry-land overlaps.
Next: C1 — inventory the city/creator draft before the next planned implementation card.
Notes: Shift + a direction is now active, camera-directed underwater swimming. Space remains the safe rise-to-surface control.
